# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

Not all people know a lot about cryptocurrencies and how they work, so the purpose of this project is to analyze a series of cryptocurrency data in order to classify them, and present them in a way that people can find this information easier to understand and visualize. with the objective that they can invest in them.

## Results

### Elbow Curve

The following elbow curve is made using the K-means method with values between 1 and 10.
We did this using unsupervised machine learning in which we identified groups of cryptocurrencies.

In this case, the value of k is 4, for which the cryptocurrencies will be categorized in a group of 4

### Visualizing Results

Using a PCA algorithm we were able to create this 3-D scatterplot, where the cryptocurrency dimensions were reduced to three

### TotalCoinMined vs TotalCoinSupply Scatter plot

In this diagram the characteristics of the cryptocurrencies are being compared, although we cannot correctly observe the different classes, therefore we will use the 3D model since it gives us a better visualization.

## Summary

We have analyzed 532 different cryptocurrencies and we have organized them depending on their class and by groups, which facilitates their understanding and easy access to much of their information, however, in order to know which of them we can invest in, we must do a more in-depth individual analysis of the data that each one of them offers us as the historical data to be able to make a prediction, and to be able to invest in them.
